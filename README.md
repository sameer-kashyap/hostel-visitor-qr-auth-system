## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional visitor entry systems rely on **manual registers**, which:
- Are error-prone
- Can be manipulated
- Do not provide reliable historical records

This project solves the problem by introducing a **digital, QR-based authentication system** that ensures every visitor is logged before entering the hostel.
